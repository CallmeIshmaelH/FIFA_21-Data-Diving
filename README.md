# FIFA_21-Data-Diving
A project for practicing Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, EDA and  Modelling using FIFA 21 player data.
Unit 2

## PROJECT
In the FIFA 21 Project we will try to predict a player's "Overall Rating" by analysing data from the following dataset: fifa21_training.csv.
This dataset is  and extract from the data available at https://sofifa.com/.

In this project the goal is to attempt to predict a playerÂ´s overall rating (OVA) based on features in the data.
The Steps for this process are as follows.
1) Cleaning: removing unnecessary columns, converting dtypes to usable formats, 
2) EDA: Developing correlation matrices and heatmaps to view relationships betwen features and the target.
3) Splitting data into Feature and Label sets
4) Train/Test Split data
5) Transform data for training a Linear Regression model
6) Train and Test models using normalized and standardized numerical data.
